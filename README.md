# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* **Objects** - Objects are used to represent real life objects. We use properties to describe traits of the object. Methods are used to demonstrate actions that the object can take.
	* **Properties** - Properties are made up of a property name like 'height' and a property value like '6 ft'. Properties allow us to group information about an object in an organized way.
	* **Methods** - Methods are behaviors or actions that an object can take. Say you have a pet at home. Your pet could take the action of eating or sleeping. Both eating and sleeping would be represented by a method. A method has a name and value just like properties. A methods value will always be a function though instead of a regular value like our 'height' and '6 ft' property example.
	* **for in loop** - A for in loop is way for us to look at all the properties 'in' a given object. Within the loop we could decide to make changes to properties or just view them.
	* **Dot notation vs bracket notation** - Dot and Bracket notation are ways for us to access object properties. We can also set object properties using both dot and bracket notation. Both notations can accomplish the same tasks but are written in different ways.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
